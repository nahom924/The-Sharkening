## Choosing a license like CC or GPL is overrated. I'm just going to make my own rules that nobody is gonna follow.


Rule 1: If you are planning to create mods out of my game and then you go ahead and publish it, then please please PLEASE give credit to me (NamelessTripmine) and at least one site I own.

Rule 2: The use of my assets anywhere else shouldn't be used for commercial purposes. That's unless you give credit to my stuff and i give permission.
Otherwise, I will probably find out and I might ruin your career on purpose.

Rule 3: I may have to file a lawsuit if you create an entire commercial business purely out of the code and assets I have created. PLEASE show some respect of my works.

Rule 4: If you make a mod out of my game, then please specify anything that you have changed.

Rule 5: If I do have a paid version of my game, and then someone goes and steal my game for the purpose of piracy, I won't do anything much and I understand why you may download a pirated copy of my game.
If you have a pirated copy of my game, then I would be grateful if you purchased the game later. It's not like I could get this done in a few days or weeks. Please show some respect.

Rule 6: Enjoy :)
